# Structured P2P Network

In structured P2P network, the overlay is organized into a specific topology, and the protocol ensures that any node can efficiently search the network for a file/resource even if the resource is extremely rare.

Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) are distributed key-value architectures that realize the structured peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay paradigm.
In such systems with `n` peers, each peer maintains communication channels to other nodes by following the DHT protocol.

Common examples of DHT overlays are `CHORD`, `Pastry` and `Kademlia`.
